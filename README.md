# Plot description
## Pokemon Data Table
The "Pokemon Data Table" plot displays a table of Pokemon names. It allows you to select a row and view details about the selected Pokemon.

## Pokemon Image
The "Pokemon Image" plot shows an image of the selected Pokemon. The image is based on the Pokemon's name.

## Radar Chart
The "Radar Chart" plot visualizes the stats (HP, Defense, Attack, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed) of the selected Pokemon. It represents each stat as a point on the chart, and the shape formed by these points gives an overview of the Pokemon's stat distribution.

## Interactive Treemap
The "Interactive Treemap" plot presents a hierarchical view of Pokemon types. Each type is represented by a rectangle, and the size of the rectangle corresponds to the count of Pokemon belonging to that type. You can interact with the treemap by clicking on the rectangles to explore the Pokemon types and their counts.

## Violin Plot
The "Violin Plot" visualizes the distribution of stats (HP, Defense, Attack, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed) for Pokemon. It displays a set of vertical violins, where the width of each violin represents the density of Pokemon with specific stat values. The boxplots inside the violins provide additional information about the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

## Contour Plot
The "Contour Plot" showcases the relationship between Attack and Defense stats of Pokemon. It uses contour lines to represent the density of points on a 2D plane, where each point corresponds to a Pokemon's Attack and Defense values. The plot provides insights into the distribution and correlation between these two stats.
